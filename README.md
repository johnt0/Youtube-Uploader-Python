# Youtube-Uploader-Python
Uploading Youtube videos via a Python program with a built-in UI. This will allow many people to save time, and be able to quickly submit their video with whatever 
title, description through this Python program. (Was mainly for submitting my speeches through Youtube) Uploads the video automically using Youtube API.
Please read Youtube Data API for better understanding of Youtube API: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3
